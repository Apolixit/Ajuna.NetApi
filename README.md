Ajuna.NetApi which was formerly called [SubstrateNetApi](https://github.com/JetonNetwork/SubstrateNetApi) is written in NETStandard2.0 to provide maximum compatibility for [Unity](https://unity.com/). The substrate node finally exposes the type definitions in the metadata, enabling the API to be generated from scratch. That feature implied a refactoring of the implemented type logic. Ajuna Network is a platform dedicated to games, it provides seamless integration of substrate nodes and enables game developers to start creating. Feedback, constructive criticism, and discussions are welcome and will help us to improve the API!

The project behind the Ajuna.NetApi, is [Ajuna Network](https://ajuna.io/) and the flagship game DOTMog, backed by the swiss company [BloGa Tech AG](admin@bloga.tech).
